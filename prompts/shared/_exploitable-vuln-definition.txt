An **exploitable vulnerability** is a confirmed source-to-sink path where the encoding and sanitization defenses are absent or mismatched for the final context. It represents a concrete opportunity for the Exploitation phase agent to execute an attack. A path is NOT a vulnerability if defenses are correctly applied, even if the data path itself is complex. Your goal is to pass only these exploitable opportunities to the next phase.
